Philadelphia 76ers Team, Player, and Salary Evaluation

Acting as consultants for the Philadelphia 76ers, my team and I evaluated the 2022-23 regular season with respect to chosen KPIs and the rest of the NBA. 
We collected season-aggregated data from the 2012-2013 season through the 2021-22 season to establish team and player KPIs and train a model to predict playersâ€™ salaries based on their performance. 
We collected identical data for the 2022-23 season to evaluate the Philadelphia 76ers this year based on these metrics and the model.
